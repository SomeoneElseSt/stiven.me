TypeScript development:
```
# Quick commands
pnpm compile         # Compile TypeScript + build blog
pnpm dev             # Watch mode for development
pnpm check           # Check for TypeScript errors
```

```
# Individual commands 
pnpm tsc             # Compile TypeScript only
pnpm tsc:watch       # Watch mode
pnpm tsc:check       # Type check only
```
