This is a repository for my personal website: stiven.me.

Run locally with:
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

TypeScript:

Compile Typescript + build blog
```
pnpm compile
```

Watch mode for development
```
pnpm dev
```

Check for TS errors
```
pnpm check
```

Or alternatively use oen of the following standalone commands:

Compile TS only 
```
pnpm tsc
```

Watch mode
```
pnpm tsc:watch
```

Type check only
```
pnpm tsc:check 
```
