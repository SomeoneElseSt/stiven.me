    <article id="post-content"><p>Here&#39;s a thought experiment: </p>
<p>If a city became the people that visited it, what would it look like? </p>
<p>To think about this, first we need to narrow down on some cities. We won&#39;t consider cities that aren&#39;t visited at a high-enough frequency, and for practical reasons, let&#39;s consider major cities only, and to keep this post to the point and familiar, major cities people flock in and out from. </p>
<p>I began asking myself this question when thinking about Tokyo.</p>
<p>Tokyo is a beautiful city. Everything in it, from the architecture to the food (and porcelain food) has been engineered by someone who thought that what they were making should be beautiful. A particularly interesting byproduct is that beauty seems to be something that can be made, bought, or both. </p>
<p>For example, most people would consider the Alps beautiful for their own sake — we don&#39;t have a way to make a copy of the Alps or to move them somewhere else, and the Alps wouldn&#39;t be the Alps if they were in Wyoming or Australia. They are uniquely European and mediterranean as Yosemite is Californian and the Eiffel tower is French. </p>
<p>Tokyo is different in this sense. Many of the things the city is known for (for example, Shibuya Square, Shrines, Anime, Japanese food, etc) all share one thing in common: it was made by someone for someone for a reason. </p>
<p>They carry a deeply intentional weight. They&#39;re not trivial or sprung out. It took years for Japanese calligraphy to be distinct; shrines have been re-made methodically for centuries to preserve their essence and background. It&#39;s clear whomever made it did it knowing others would look at their work and wanted it to be taken to a high-standard. </p>
<p>This reflects on the people who visit the city. If you had to describe Tokyo tourists at first glance, it would average out nicely to say they would feel more at home in a fashion show than in a high-rise office. </p>
<p>Tourists drawn to the city seem, at least at a superficial level, very interested in how they look and what they&#39;re looking at. From branded uniforms to tees with Japanese anime and exotic dark outifts, nobody woke up and threw on a shirt and jeans. This makes sense if you consider most of the tourists that come to Tokyo do so because of how it looks than a higher-order motive.</p>
<p>People go to the Himalayas, Delhi, Jerusalem, and the Mecca because they expect to be someone different after they&#39;ve gone and come back to their countries. Climbed the highest peak in the world? That probably makes you a better founder. Connected with religion and god? It may just help out in the afterlife. </p>
<p>This is not so true of places that are known more for their looks and feel than some intrinsic meaning. Although this is not to say that how they look and feel can&#39;t carry its own weight (or then how would Paris be the city of romance and New York the city of power?).</p>
<p>Coming back to the question above, an educated guess would say that Tokyo by its tourists it would be a wealthy, high-quality of life center where people appreciate beauty and want to craft it with certain thoughtfulness. </p>
<p>While the statement above may or not be true, it draws on many parallels with Japanese culture and Tokyo that are non-negligible. Japanese culture after all is highly interested in the creation and preservation of beauty. So the people that visit a city do indeed reflect to some extent what characterizes that city. </p>
<p>People who care about beauty will likely visit beautiful cities. People who care about power will likely visit powerful cities, and people who care about culture will likely go to places with intrinsic value not attached to what is actually visible. </p>
<p>If these cities became the people who visited them, I&#39;d bet on two phenomena:</p>
<ol>
<li>The world would be more westernized and affluent, since tourists are generally more affluent and globalized. </li>
<li>There would be bigger deltas between city measurements that compare quality of life, income, education, etc.</li>
<li>Cities would be ever-more highly specialized, with radically different norms and outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing this, we can think about what cities would be more likely to win considering who visits them and why. </p>
<p>I figured the most interesting comparison would be Tokyo vs. San Francisco, because San Francisco is a polar opposite of Tokyo in a good set of areas. </p>
<p>Tokyo is one amongst many cities where one could go for beauty and candor. San Francisco, in the other hand, is atomized and iconic. There isn&#39;t a &#39;second-best&#39; to San Francisco because any city trying really just wants its startups and mentees to go to SF so it can become reputable enough for SF-caliber people to go and build there. </p>
<p>Of course, talking about San Francisco is not really talking about SF — it&#39;s talking about the people and organizations in the city. This is why it&#39;s been the north star for at least two major tech revolutions within the last 40 years. </p>
<p>For the same reason, people who visit San Francisco generally believe it is the north star to some aspect of their lives. In fact, it&#39;s important enough that they&#39;re willing to sleep in inflatable mattresses and eat ramen for the off-chance of being in the next big thing.</p>
<p>This tells a lot about the type of person that goes to San Francisco: they hope to be part of something that will change the world as we know it, get rich in the process, and find other people who want to do the same thing to do it with. Without these people that came in over the years, SF would just be a unjustifiably expensive sea-side town with a cool bridge and a couple of decent parks. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that these comparisons are slightly unfair. The very-touristy places are that way for a tourism-related reason (eg. unique geography, culture, etc), but it is undeniable that before they were touristy, there was a major hand played by the culture cultivated by its inhabitants that reflects on the kind of people who choose to visit them.</p>
<p>This is to say someone visiting a city has more in common with the people in it and its ethos than if they were dropped off in a random metropolis, and this will matter over the long run as the world becomes more global and people choose to live where they feel they belong the most. </p>
<p>If borders were open, there would be many other San Franciscos with immigrants that have something in common coming together due to a local circumstance or sub-culture (except they probably wouldn&#39;t be about technology). </p>
<p>I originally chose to write on this because, having lived in the bay area for close to a year, Tokyo comes as quite the cultural shock. Generally, people visiting San Francisco do so because they were invited - brought in due to being best-in-class. Tokyo on the other hand has given me the impression that being hip is more related to wether you can afford it than directly tied to any meaningful competition or merit. </p>
<p>Each city&#39;s definition of what&#39;s &#39;trendy&#39; and important is loudly different (although SF&#39;s version of trendy now seems to be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/entrepreneurship/artificial-intelligence-startup-founders-bc730406?mod=Searchresults&pos=3&page=1">overworking your way to being rich</a>), but hubs for risk-taking have been more responsible for societal advance than aesthetic hubs historically.</p>
<p>This is not to disregard Tokyo. </p>
<p>In SF, just about anyone with a computer and an internet connection can do something; If you want to be hip in Tokyo, though, I think it&#39;s more of a metter of wether you can afford it or not. </p>
