    <article id="post-content"><p>Here&#39;s a thought experiment: </p>
<p>If a city eventually became the people that visited it, ie. its tourists, what would it look like? </p>
<p>To think about this, first we need to narrow down on some cities.</p>
<p>We won&#39;t talk about cities that aren&#39;t generally visited or visited at a high-enough frequency to have a generous sample from which to infer off of. For practical reasons, let&#39;s consider major cities only, and to keep this post to the point and familiar, major cities people are flock in and out from. </p>
<p>I originally devised this question when thinking about Tokyo and San Francisco. </p>
<p>Tokyo is a beautiful city. Everything in it, from the architecture to the food (and porcelain food) has been engineered with a sentiment that things should be beautiful.</p>
<p>A particularly interesting characteristic of Tokyo is that, beauty here seems to be something that can be made, bought, or both. For example, most people would consider the Alps as beautiful for their own sake — we don&#39;t have a way to make a second Alps or to move them somewhere else, and the Alps wouldn&#39;t be the Alps if they were in Wyoming or Australia. They are uniquely European and mediterranean as Yosemite is Californian. </p>
<p>Tokyo is different in this sense. Shibuya Square, Shrines, Anime, Delicious Sushi and Japanese food all share one thing in common: it was made by someone for someone for a reason. There is a deeply intentional feeling when you look around, because nothing is made trivially nor was it sprung out - it took years for Japanese calligraphy to be distinct; shrines have been re-made methodically for centuries to preserve their essence and background. </p>
<p>This reflects on the people who visit the city. If you had to describe Tokyo tourists at first glance, it would average out nicely to say they would feel more at home in a fashion show than in a high-rise office. </p>
<p>The people drawn to the city seem, at least superficially, very interested in how they look and what they&#39;re looking at. From North-Face uniforms to tees with Japanese anime and exotic dark outifts, nobody just woke up and threw on a shirt and jeans. This makes sense if you consider most people that come to Tokyo do so because of how it looks than what it means for their lives in a higher-order.</p>
<p>People go to the Himalayas, Delhi, Jerusalem, and the Mecca because they expect to be someone different after they&#39;ve gone and come back to their countries. Climbed the highest peak in the world? That probably makes you a better founder. Connected with god and religious history? It may help out in the afterlife. </p>
<p>This is not so true of places like Tokyo, or generalizing, other high-flying cities known more for how they look and feel than for some instrinsic meaning within them. Although this is not to say that how they look and feel can&#39;t carry its own weight (or then how would Paris be the city of romance and New York the city of power).</p>
<p>Coming back to the question above, an educated guess would say that if Tokyo became its tourists, it would be a wealthy, high-quality of life center for beautiful people that appreciate beauty and want to craft it with delicacy. </p>
<p>While you may or may not agree with the statement above, it draws on many parallels with Japanese culture and Tokyo that are non-negligible. Japanese culture after all is highly interested in the creation and preservation of beauty. So the people that visit a city do indeed reflect to some extent what characterizes that city. </p>
<p>People who care about beauty will likely visit beautiful cities. People who care about power will likely visit powerful cities, and people who care about culture will likely go to places with intrinsic value that&#39;s not attached to what is actually visible. </p>
<p>If those cities then became the people who visited them, we would see 1) a more westernized and affluent world, since generally people who can visit cities are from western countries, and 2) a bigger delta in different areas and metrics which can be used to define the character of a city relative to another, i.e., highly focused societies with radically different norms and outcomes. </p>
<p>Knowing this, we can think about what cities would be more likely to win judging by the people who choose to visit them and their motivations to do so. </p>
<p>I figured the most interesting one would be San Francisco, because San Francisco is a polar opposite of Tokyo in a good set of areas. </p>
<p>Tokyo is one amongst many cities where one could go to find beauty and candor. San Francisco is atomized and iconic. There isn&#39;t a second best to San Francisco because any city like San Francisco is hoping its startups do eventually go to San Francisco so it can become reputable enough for San Francisco caliber people and startups to eventually settle there as they learn of a place of comparable enough quality that it can knock on the door of the entrepreneurial creme de la creme. </p>
<p>Of course, talking about San Francisco is not related to the city at all. It&#39;s all about the people and organizations set up there that make it interesting. It&#39;s been a north star for the major tech revolutions of the last 40 years, but if all AI companies were headquartered in Seattle due to a concentration of machine learning engineers, there is a fair chance San Francisco would lose its monolith status. </p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the case, however. People who visit San Francisco do generally believe it is the north star to some aspect of their lives. In fact, it is such an important one that they&#39;re willing to sleep in inflatable mattresses and eat ramen for the off-chance of being in the next big thing.</p>
<p>This tells a lot about San Francisco visitors (and to some extent, tourists): wherever they go, there&#39;s something that has the chance to change the world as we know it, so there is probably a concentration of smart people with divergent ideas about what it is and how to make it happen. </p>
<p>The unique detail of San Francisco is that its people are far more important than the city per se. Without technology and entrepreneurship, San Francisco would be a badly expensive sea-side town with decent parks and great food. </p>
<p>San Francisco already accomplished the thought experiment posed at the beginning of this paper, as the many generations that came in for gold rush after gold rush have ended up becoming its inhabitants and workers who love the city because of being surrounded by people so uniquely like each other. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that these comparisons are slightly unfair, as the very-touristy places are that way for a tourism-related reason (eg. unique geography, exquisite culture, etc), but it is undeniable that before they were touristy, there was a major hand played by the culture cultivated by its inhabitants that reflects on the people who choose to visit them.</p>
<p>This is to say someone visiting a city has more in common with the people in that city than if they were dropped off in a random metropolis, and this will matter over the long run as the world becomes more global and people choose to live where they feel they belong the most. If open borders were universal, there would be many other San Franciscos with immigrants that have something in common stemming from a local culture (except they probably wouldn&#39;t be about technology). </p>
<p>Although, there are few reasons besides being part of the next big thing that might make someone relocate to a city for its own sake without an extrinsic, monetary, or material reward (how many fashionistas would relocate to Paris if its borders were open?). </p>
<p>There is also some aspect to risk-taking that makes SF the exception and perhaps not the best example. </p>
<p>SF is the capital of risk-taking, so it would make sense more people are willing to come, since they likely are risk-taking and go there precisely to put that to good use. </p>
<p>I originally chose to write this because, having lived in the bay area for close to a year that felt like a lifetime, Tokyo is quite the cultural shock. Generally, people visiting San Francisco are visiting because they were invited - brought in thanks to being best-in-class. It seems to me that people visiting Tokyo are visiting because they chose to be somewhere beautiful and trendy, which happens to be their matching &#39;vibe&#39;, while in SF so long as you could code or wanted to learn no one could care less about how you looked and whether or not you were trendy. To be trendy was to have done something; it didn&#39;t exist in what you wore on how you lived (although the latter might unfortunately be changing with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/entrepreneurship/artificial-intelligence-startup-founders-bc730406?mod=Searchresults&pos=3&page=1">996</a>).</p>
<p>In this sense, being someone wasn&#39;t something that could be bought or exchanged; it was equally attainable and merit based. You were there not because you could afford to be, but because in the past there was some grander vision that culminated in San Francisco, and there is something deeply beautiful to letting loose the best people in the world to find what it wants and (hopefully) improve living standards for everyone. </p>
<p>This is partly inspired by Paul Graham&#39;s Cities and Ambition, which you can read <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html">here</a>.</p>
